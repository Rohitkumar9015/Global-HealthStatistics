Pivot Table Important Questions:
Using the provided dataset columns, here are key questions that can be addressed using pivot tables:

General Trends and Comparisons
1.What is the average Prevalence Rate by Country and Disease Category?
2.How does the mortality rate vary across different disease categories?
3.Which age group and gender are most people affected by diseases?
4.What is the average recovery rate (%) for diseases by country?
5.How do the Treatment Type affect mortality and recovery rates?
Time-Based Analysis
6.How has the incidence rate of specific diseases changed over the years?
7.Which countries have shown the greatest improvement in healthcare access (%) in the last five years?
8.What is the average Urbanization Rate by Country and Year?
Economic and Healthcare Access
9.What is the relationship between per capita income and average treatment costs across countries?
10.Which countries have the highest healthcare access (%) and recovery rates?
11.What is the average Treatment Cost by Country and Age Group?
12.What is the average Per Capita Income (USD) by Country and Disease Category?
13.How does the number of Doctors per 1000 vary by Disease Category and Gender?
Disease-Specific Analysis
14.Which disease categories have the highest Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)?
15.How does the prevalence of a specific disease vary across different age groups?
16.How does DALYs vary across different Disease Categories and Countries?
Correlation Important Questions:
Correlations between columns can reveal underlying relationships. Key questions include:

Healthcare and Outcomes:
1.Is there a strong correlation between healthcare access (%) and recovery rates?
2.How do doctors per 1,000 people correlate with mortality rates?
Economic Factors:
3.What is the relationship between per capita income and disease prevalence and mortality rates?

Visualization Important Questions:
Creating visualizations can answer these questions:

Geographic Trends:
1.Which regions or countries have the highest disease burden? (Choropleth Map)
2.How do mortality rates vary globally for different diseases? (Heatmap)
Time Trends:
3.How has the prevalence or incidence of diseases changed over time? (Line Chart)
4.Which countries have seen the most improvement in healthcare outcomes over 5 years? (Bar Chart)
Disease Impact Analysis:
